# arp-scopex-sim
This is a simple kinematic simulation of a propeller-driven research balloon platform written in C++ using [Open Dynamics Engine](http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual). We will use this model to anticipate the stability of the platform and to tune our control algorithms.

The model is capable of producing 3D graphics under X-Windows, but we will probably not focus much effort on that, as the really interesting data can be obtained from the log files and analyzed in Matlab.
